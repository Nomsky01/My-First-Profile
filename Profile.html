My name is Onome and am an aspiring web developer. Aspiring because as that this time last week, I had to clue how to do what am doing right now. But one of those days as I was perusing through facebook, I saw this comment by a man inviting people for a training on programming and I picked immediate interest. It was something I had been searching for a very long time now and it was at my door step. I quickly signed up and voila! here I am today. Its been the best five days of my life so far. Everyday I learn new things and prior to this class i had form of training whatsoever except a one time dabble with python and it wasnt even clear. So am doing this right now to tell anyone out there [FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS]. It doesnt matter how long or how hard it seems at first, if you push hard and never give up, you will get there.</p>
